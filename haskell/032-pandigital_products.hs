-- Pandigital products
-- Problem 32
--
-- We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits
-- 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
-- The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand,
-- multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
-- Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can
-- be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
-- HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
-- include it once in your sum.

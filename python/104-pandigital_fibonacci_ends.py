# Pandigital Fibonacci ends
# Problem 104
# 
# The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
# Fn = Fnâˆ’1 + Fnâˆ’2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
# It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
# Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
